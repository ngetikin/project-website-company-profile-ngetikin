## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (LTS recommended, e.g., v18.x or v20.x)
-   Bun (v1.x or higher) - primary package manager for this project, or npm (v8.x or higher)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ngetikin/project-website-company-profile-ngetikin.git
    cd project-website-company-profile-ngetikin
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    # Using Bun (recommended)
    bun install

    # Alternatively, using npm
    # npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment setup**
    This project typically doesn't require complex environment variables for a basic company profile. If you need any, create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env # (If .env.example existed, otherwise create an empty .env)
    # Example:
    # NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
    ```
    *(No `.env.example` was detected, so this is a general placeholder.)*

4.  **Start development server**
    ```bash
    # Using Bun
    bun run dev

    # Alternatively, using npm
    # npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Open your browser**
    Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Environment variables can be used for sensitive information or configuration that changes between deployments. For client-side access in Next.js, variables must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

| Variable         | Description                                       | Default | Required |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_...` | Any public-facing variables needed by the frontend | N/A     | No       |
| `...`            | Any server-side variables for Next.js API routes  | N/A     | No       |

### Configuration Files
-   `next.config.ts`: Main configuration file for Next.js, handling build settings, image optimization, and more.
-   `tailwind.config.ts` (expected inside `src/styles` or project root): Tailwind CSS configuration for customizing themes, plugins, and utility classes.
-   `postcss.config.mjs`: Configuration for PostCSS plugins, including Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer.
-   `eslint.config.mjs`: ESLint configuration for defining code style rules and detecting potential issues.
-   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler options for the project.

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts
The following scripts are defined in `package.json` for development tasks:

| Command             | Description                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `bun run dev`       | Starts the Next.js development server on `localhost:3000`. |
| `bun run build`     | Creates an optimized production build of the application. |
| `bun run start`     | Starts the Next.js production server (after building). |
| `bun run lint`      | Runs ESLint to check for code style issues and errors. |

### Development Workflow
1.  Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
2.  Install dependencies using `bun install`.
3.  Start the development server with `bun run dev`.
4.  Make changes to the source code in the `src/` directory. The development server will hot-reload automatically.
5.  Run `bun run lint` frequently to maintain code quality.

## 🧪 Testing

This project does not include explicit testing frameworks or configurations in its top-level structure. For comprehensive testing, consider integrating:
-   **Jest** or **Vitest** for unit and integration testing of React components and utility functions.
-   **Cypress** or **Playwright** for end-to-end testing of the application's user flows.

## 🚀 Deployment

The application can be built for production and deployed to various hosting providers.

### Production Build
To create an optimized build for production:
```bash
bun run build
```
This will generate the production-ready assets in the `.next/` directory.

### Deployment Options
-   **Vercel**: This project is ideally suited for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), the creators of Next.js, as indicated by the repository's homepage. Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will automatically detect and deploy your Next.js application.
-   **Other Hosting**: The `build` output can also be deployed to other Node.js compatible hosting environments.
